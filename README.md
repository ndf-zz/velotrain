# velotrain

velotrain reads raw transponder passing information from a set
of up to 9 Chronelec Protime decoders, filters the messages according
to track configuration parameters and then emits valid timing
measurements as JSON-encoded objects to MQTT.


## Telegraph (MQTT) Interface

The topics below are relative to the configured basetopic (default:
'velotrain'), from the persepective of the velotrain process. For
all JSON encoded objects, invalid or unavailable properties will be
reported as null. Examples use the default basetopic.


### passing (publish)

Issue filtered and accepted passing records. Passing records
are JSON encoded objects with the following properties:

   - index : (integer) index of the passing record (reset to 0 each day)
   - date: (string) Date of the passing formatted YYYY-MM-DD
   - time: (string) Time of day of the passing formatted HH:MM:SS.dc

     or 'marker'
   - env: (list) [tmperature, humidity, pressure] where each value
     is a float value in units degrees Celsius, %rh, and hPa respectively
   - moto: (string) Proximity to moto in seconds if drafted
   - elap: (string) Elapsed time since last start gate or start of run
     formatted HH:MM:SS.dc
   - lap: (string) Time for the last full lap to the measurement point

### request (subscribe)

Receive requests for replay of passing records to the nominated serial
and filtered according to the optional JSON encoded object:

   - serial (string) optional request serial, appended to replay topic
   - index (list) [first, last] limit response to include passings from
     index first to index last.
   - time (list) [starttime, endtime] limit response to passingd between
     starttime and endtime strings formatted HH:MM:SS.dc
   - mpid (list) [mpid, ...] include only the nominated mpids in response
   - refid (list) [refid, ...] include only nominated transponder ids
     in response
   - marker (list) [marker, ...] include only passings following the
     nominated marker strings

Example: Request all passings, publish to default topic

	Topic:		velotrain/request
	Payload:	b''

Request a replay of passing 254 to 'xxfd'

	Topic:		velotrain/request
	Payload:	{"serial": "xxfd", "index": 254}

Replay passings from transponder '123456' and start gate after midday
before index 10000 and that occur following manual markers 'one' and 'two'

	Topic:		velotrain/request
	Payload:	{"refid": ["123456", "gate"],
			 "time": ["12:00:00", null],
			 "index": [null, 10000],
			 "marker": ["one", "two"]}


### replay[/serial] (publish)

Issues a JSON encoded list of passing objects, filtered according
to a provided request.


### marker (subscribe)

Insert the provided utf-8 encoded unicode payload as a manual marker
passing. If the supplied payload is empty, 'marker' is used.

Example: Insert an emoticon 'ðŸ¤·' (U+1F937) at the current time of day

	Topic:		velotrain/marker
	Payload:	b'\xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7'

### reset (subscribe)

Start a reset process, authorised by the provided utf-8 encoded 
authkey (config option 'authkey'). For a Tag Heuer Protime decoder network,
this process may take up to three minutes to complete. For systems
with foreign timers, this request will just clear passing records.

Example: Request reser process using authkey 'qwertyuiop'

	Topic:		velotrain/reset
	Payload:	b'qwertyuiop'


### timer (subscribe)

Receive raw passing data from a foreign timing device. Foreign timing
records are utf-8 encoded unicode strings in the format:

	INDEX;SOURCE;CHANNEL;REFID;TOD

Where the fields are as follows:

   - INDEX: ignored
   - SOURCE: measurement point id as a metarace timing channel
     eg: 'C1', 'C2', 'C3', ... 'C9'
   - CHANNEL: ignored
   - REFID: transponder ID eg '123456'
   - TOD: time of day of passing as string eg: '1:23.456', 'now', '12:34:56.789'

Note: velotrain expects each attached decoder to be triggered from a
reference clock at the top of each minute, and to report a passing with
refid matching config option 'trig' (default: '255').
For systems that maintain synchronisation via a
different mechanism, a fake top of minute tigger can be sent
with the channel of the configured sync source (config key 'sync')
at any time using the trig refid and a TOD of '0'.

Example: Insert a passing for transponder '123456' on mpid 3 at the current time

	Payload: b';C3;;123456;now'

Fake a top-of-minute message to mpid 1, using the default trig:

	Payload: b';C1;;255;0'

Insert a passing for transponder '123456' on mpid 4, 10.2345 seconds after 2 pm:

	Payload: b';C4;;123456;14:00:10.2345'
